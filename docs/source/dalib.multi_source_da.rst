Multi Source Domain Adaptation
==========================================

-----------
Benchmarks
-----------

We provide benchmarks of different multi source domain adaptation algorithms on *Office-Home* and *DomainNet* as follows.
Note that `Origin` means the accuracy reported by the original paper, while `Avg` is the accuracy reported by DALIB.
