## Introduction

This is the development branch for *Trans-Learn*. 
Compared with the master version, we have added

- Regression DA ï¼ˆincluding Source Only, DD)
- Unsupervised DA (including MCC)
- Partial DA (DANN, PADA, IWAN)
- Open Set DA (DANN, OSBP)
- Segmentation DA (ADVENT, FDA, CycleGAN, Cycada)

We are planning to add
- Segmentation DA (Self-training methods)
- Keypoint Detection DA
- Finetune Library (ftlib)


*Trans-Learn* is a Transfer Learning library based on pure PyTorch with high performance and friendly API. 
Our code is pythonic, and the design is consistent with torchvision. You can easily develop new algorithms, or easily apply existing algorithms..
