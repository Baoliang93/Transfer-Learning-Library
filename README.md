## Introduction
This is the development branch for *Trans-Learn*. Currently we are working on 

- Regression DA ï¼ˆincluding Source Only, DANN, DAN, MCD and MDD)
- Unsupervised DA (including MCC)
- Partial DA (PADA)
- Open Set DA (OSBP)
- Finetune Library (ftlib)

There might be many errors and changes in this branch. Please refer [master](https://github.com/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library) for stable version.

*Trans-Learn* is a Transfer Learning library based on pure PyTorch with high performance and friendly API. 
Our code is pythonic, and the design is consistent with torchvision. You can easily develop new algorithms, or easily apply existing algorithms..
